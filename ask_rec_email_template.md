Subject: Request for Recommendation for Young Researcher's Green Card Application

Dear Dr. [RECOMMENDER_LAST_NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [PERSONAL_FIRST_NAME] [PERSONAL_LAST_NAME], a recent [EDU_DEGREE_2] graduate from [EDU_UNIVERSITY_2], where I was mentored by Professors [MENTOR_1_NAME]. Currently, I am a [CURRENT_POSITION] at [CURRENT_COMPANY], focusing on [RESEARCH_FIELD_PRIMARY] for [INDUSTRY_APPLICATION].

I want to express my gratitude for your impactful contributions to [RECOMMENDER_FIELD], particularly your work on [RECOMMENDER_PAPER_TITLE]. I was especially excited to see my co-authored works referenced in your research:

[PUBLICATION_1]

Your insightful discussion on [RECOMMENDER_RESEARCH_FOCUS] aligns closely with my research. It is inspiring to see our contributions advancing the field together.

As an international researcher, I am applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, which emphasizes contributions to fields of critical importance such as [NATIONAL_PRIORITY_AREAS]. To strengthen my application, I am required to provide independent recommendation letters from esteemed researchers.

Given your expertise in [RECOMMENDER_EXPERTISE] and the connection between your research and mine, I would be deeply honored if you could write a recommendation letter on my behalf. Such a letter would highlight the relevance of my research and its broader implications for public and environmental benefits.

I am happy to provide a draft letter or additional materials for your review if needed. Thank you very much for considering my request. I greatly appreciate your time and guidance.

Best regards,
[PERSONAL_FULL_NAME], [EDU_DEGREE_2]
