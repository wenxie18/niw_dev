  "TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES": "Measuring Attention at Scale  Challenge: Traditional methods (e.g., surveys, lab studies) fail to capture attention dynamics in today\u2019s fragmented digital landscape.  Solution: Developed computer vision pipelines (e.g., eye-tracking algorithms, TVision data fusion) to quantify attention across 1M+ ads, enabling real-time optimization.  Impact: Reduces the $300B annual U.S. digital ad waste problem by identifying which creatives actually engage viewers.  Auditing Representation in Marketing  Challenge: Lack of tools to objectively measure diversity (e.g., skin-tone distribution) in brand content.  Solution: Created first pixel-level skin-tone detection models for ads, uncovering systemic biases (e.g., 23% underrepresentation of darker skin tones in beauty ads).  Impact: Supports FTC/EEOC guidelines on equitable advertising and corporate accountability.  Optimizing Cross-Platform Ad Strategies  Challenge: Brands struggle to adapt creatives for TikTok, TV, and mobile without costly trial-and-error.  Solution: Built multimodal AI models (visual + audio) to predict attention shifts, enabling automated ad shortening and placement.  Impact: Helps U.S. businesses compete in the $17B short-form video ad market dominated by foreign platforms (e.g., TikTok).",
  "POSITIVE_OUTCOMES": " Economic Growth & Industry Efficiency  Reduces Advertising Waste: My AI-driven attention models help brands optimize $300B+ in annual U.S. digital ad spending, minimizing resources spent on ignored or ineffective ads.  Boosts Small Businesses: By democratizing access to low-cost, AI-powered ad analytics (e.g., my skin-tone detection tools), local and minority-owned businesses can compete with larger brands in multicultural markets.  2. Advancing Equity & Corporate Accountability  Promotes Fair Representation: My skin-tone auditing tools empower regulators and advocacy groups to hold brands accountable for inclusive advertising, aligning with FTC/EEOC diversity guidelines.  Counters Algorithmic Bias: By exposing disparities in ad targeting (e.g., underrepresented groups seeing fewer high-opportunity ads), my work informs policies to ensure equitable access to goods/services.  3. Strengthening U.S. Tech Leadership  Competitiveness in Short-Form Video: My multimodal ad-optimization models help U.S. brands and platforms (e.g., YouTube, Meta) compete with foreign rivals like TikTok in the $17B short-form video market.  AI Innovation Transfer: Methods I developed for marketing (e.g., causal inference + CV) are now applied in healthcare (patient attention to PSAs) and education (e.g., optimizing educational video engagement).  4. Consumer Wellbeing & Privacy  Reduces Ad Fatigue: By identifying \"attention-respecting\" ad designs, my work mitigates intrusive advertising\u2014a top consumer complaint in the 2023 Pew Digital Privacy Survey.  Supports Informed Choices: My research on review credibility (e.g., identity-driven bias) helps platforms like Yelp and Google prioritize trustworthy consumer feedback.",
  "ANALYSIS_FOCUS": "Leveraging AI and behavioral science to optimize digital advertising efficiency, equity, and consumer experience\u2014addressing three critical national priorities:  Economic Productivity  My computer vision models analyze attention patterns across 1M+ ads, helping businesses minimize the $300B annual U.S. digital ad waste (IAB, 2023). This directly boosts ROI for companies\u2014especially SMBs competing in crowded markets.  Social Equity in Media  My skin-tone detection algorithms audit representation gaps in advertising (e.g., finding 23% underrepresentation of darker skin tones in beauty ads). This supports FTC/EEOC efforts to combat algorithmic bias and promotes inclusive marketing.  U.S. Competitiveness in AI  By pioneering multimodal ad optimization (visual + audio fusion), my work helps U.S. platforms like YouTube and Meta counter the dominance of foreign short-form video apps (e.g., TikTok) in the $17B influencer ad market.",
  "METHODOLOGY_INTEGRATION": "I combine computational, behavioral, and causal inference tools in a three-layer framework to study digital advertising\u2019s impact at scale:  Layer 1: Data Engineering & Multimodal AI  Tools: Computer vision (OpenCV, ResNet), NLP (BERT, Llama), and audio processing (Librosa) to extract features from ads, eye-tracking videos, and social media.  Example: Built a two-stream neural network to fuse visual and audio data from 100K+ video ads, achieving 94% accuracy in predicting attention drops (published at ICPR 2024).  Layer 2: Causal & Behavioral Validation  Tools: Propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and lab/field experiments to isolate cause-effect relationships.  Example: Used natural experiments at Snapchat to prove that ad-story congruence increases watch time by 22% (under review at JMR).  Layer 3: Real-World Deployment  Tools: A/B testing, collaboration with industry partners (Apple, Snap), and policy audits (e.g., FTC diversity guidelines).  Example: Deployed skin-tone detection algorithms to audit 50K+ brand posts, revealing systemic biases now cited in EEOC diversity reports.",
