This work benefits the nation by driving economic growth in the digital economy, enabling businesses to reach audiences more accurately, reducing wasted advertising spend, and promoting social equity through fair and responsible AI-driven content delivery. Ultimately, it supports innovation, competitiveness, and inclusive communication in the rapidly evolving media landscape.. Achieving this goal requires None. Traditional methods, however, often struggle with To address the main challenges in my field—such as improving advertising effectiveness, handling large-scale multimodal data, and ensuring fairness in AI systems—several key steps are needed. These include developing robust machine learning models that can accurately predict audience engagement across diverse platforms, designing scalable data pipelines capable of processing vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, and creating techniques to detect and mitigate bias in algorithmic decision-making. My research contributes by proposing novel algorithms and frameworks that enhance prediction accuracy, improve data integration from multiple sources, and promote social equity through responsible AI practices.. These shortcomings can lead to If the challenges in my field are not addressed, the nation could face significant economic inefficiencies due to ineffective advertising, resulting in wasted marketing budgets and reduced business competitiveness. Additionally, without robust methods to ensure fairness and reduce bias, AI-driven advertising systems may perpetuate social inequities, leading to unfair representation and exclusion of diverse audiences. This could undermine public trust in digital media platforms and hinder efforts toward inclusive communication and equitable access to information..
