Subject: Request for Recommendation for Young Researcher's Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Demanet,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Yuan Zi, a recent Ph.D. graduate from University of Houston, where I was mentored by Professors Jiefu Chen and Zhu Han. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at Gowell International, focusing on electromagnetic (EM) well-logging for well-integrity monitoring.

I want to express my gratitude for your impactful contributions to AI in geophysics, particularly your work on Learning with Real Data Without Real Labels: A Strategy for Extrapolated Full-Waveform Inversion with Field Data. I was especially excited to see my co-authored works referenced in your research:

Jin, Y., Zi, Y., Hu, W., Hu, Y., Wu, X., Chen, J., 2022. A Robust Learning Method for Low-Frequency Extrapolation in GPR Full Waveform Inversion, IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett., 19, 1–5.
Jin, Y., Hu, W., Wang, S., Zi, Y., Wu, X., Chen, J., 2022. Efficient Progressive Transfer Learning for Full-Waveform Inversion with Extrapolated Low-Frequency Reflection Seismic Data, IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 60, pp. 1-10.

Your insightful discussion on leveraging low-frequency extrapolation for FWI aligns closely with my research. It is inspiring to see our contributions advancing the field together.

As an international researcher, I am applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, which emphasizes contributions to fields of critical importance such as environmental monitoring and sustainability. To strengthen my application, I am required to provide independent recommendation letters from esteemed researchers.

Given your expertise in AI for geophysics and the connection between your research and mine, I would be deeply honored if you could write a recommendation letter on my behalf. Such a letter would highlight the relevance of my research and its broader implications for public and environmental benefits.

I am happy to provide a draft letter or additional materials for your review if needed. Thank you very much for considering my request. I greatly appreciate your time and guidance.

Best regards,
Yuan Zi, Ph.D.
